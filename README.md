# Ctigris_genome_scripts

This repository contains five scripts that were used to calculate genome statistics for a Crotalus tigris assembly. Inputs varied among scrips but included genomic scaffolds as fasta files, gff files, bed, and bedGraph files.

Instructions for running each script are available through the -h flag.

These scripts were written and originally run in python version 3.7.6 and have not been tested with other python versions. Anyone is welcome to use these scripts, but I make no guarantees and promise no support for getting them to run on any machines other than my own.
